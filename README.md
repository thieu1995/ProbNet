## üåü Overview

**ProbNet** is a lightweight and extensible Python library that provides a unified implementation of 
**Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)** and its key variant, the **General Regression Neural Network (GRNN)**. 
It supports both **classification** and **regression** tasks, making it suitable for a wide range of 
supervised learning applications.

## üîß Features

- üß† Full implementation of PNN for classification
- üìà GRNN for regression modeling
- üîç Scikit-learn compatible interface (`fit`, `predict`, `score`)
- üîÑ Built-in support for many kernels and distance metrics
- üß™ Fast prototyping and evaluation
- üß© Easily extendable and readable codebase
- üìö Auto-generated documentation with Sphinx 
- Probabilistic models: `PnnClassifier`, `GrnnRegressor`

## üì¶ Installation

You can install the library using `pip` (once published to PyPI):

```bash
pip install probnet
```

After installation, you can import ProbNet as any other Python module:

```sh
$ python
>>> import probnet
>>> probnet.__version__
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

For Classification using PNN:

```python
from probnet import PnnClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = PnnClassifier(sigma=0.1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Accuracy:", model.score(X_test, y_test))
```

For Regression using GRNN:

```python
from probnet import GrnnRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = GrnnRegressor(sigma=0.5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("R2 Score:", model.score(X_test, y_test))
```

As can be seen, you do it like any model from Scikit-Learn library such as SVC, RF, DT,...
